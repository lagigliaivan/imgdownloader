# Proper Case Challenge: SWE Coding
Case 1
Write the program described above that when executed downloads the first ten memes on the
homepage of the url and stores those images locally in a folder. Name the images 1.jpg … 10.jpg

Case 2
Extend the program to accept a parameter named `amount` that determines how many memes
need to be downloaded. Hint: if it's more than on the first page, I expect the program to go to the
next page.

Case 3
Enable the above program to run on multiple threads. With an additional Parameter sent as
`threads` that is a number between 1 and 5, parallelize the process while continuing to support the
`amount` flag.

Case 4 (Bonus if you’re feeling excited)
Describe or showcase a testing strategy for the program. This could be unit, integration, or end to
end tests.
